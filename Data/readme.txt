This folder include some water level and discharge data to run the Dominent connection length and Total connection length code.
The water levels and discharges are the results from the LISFLOOD-FP model ()
The results were saved every 4h, so one time step is 4h. 
The number of the file name associates with the number of time steps. 
To change to the hours, we need to multiply the time steps by 4h.
