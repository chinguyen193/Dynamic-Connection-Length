# Dynamic-Connection-Length
This is the code for the hydrological connectivity analysis.
The calculation of dynamic connection length includes the Dominant connection length (Dominant_connection_length.py) and Total connection length (Total_connection_length.py)

More details on model setups, data requirement and analysis can be found in the research paper:
